## Introduction
This repository contains a series of mini-games developed with C++ and the Raylib library. The games included are popular and simple to understand, making it a great starting point for those interested in learning game development fundamentals using C++.

## Features
- **Modular Structure**: Each game is in its own directory with clear organization.
- **Starter Template**: A base template to help you quickly set up new projects.
- **Classic Games**: Includes beginner-friendly games like Pong, Snake, and Wall Breaking.
- **Easy to Extend**: Encourages the addition of new features and enhancements.
  
## Usage

To run the games, it is recommended to open each specific game project directory individually in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Opening the main repository with multiple folders in VS Code might cause issues when running the code directly.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the specific game folder you want to run (e.g., `Wall_Breaking_Game`, `Pong_Game`, `Snake_Game`).
2. Open that folder in VS Code using:
